The stars have aligned in a strange way over Sweden and something
quite out of the ordinary has happened: a former director of a government
authority has started to talk openly about the
[de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto)
legislative process that goes on within the executive branch of the government.
She seems to be arguing, in court, that her decision to suspend 
certain laws should have been respected by the judicial system, that it was an everyday
occurrence, and that her employment at the highest levels of the
executive branch should not have been terminated as a consequence
of her actions.

With this information we can [infer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
a number of models of the Swedish government that could describe how the state
actually functions. The most extreme model [inferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
in this post is presented in Figure 1.

![The most extreme model of the Swedish de facto system of government inferred in this post](/img/sweden-de-facto-4.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 1. The most extreme model of
the Swedish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> system of government 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">inferred</a> in this post. Blue parts are
fully public. Grey parts are the relevant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a>
government bodies. Black parts are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">inferred</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> bodies of government.
The Regering, or it's employees, seem to be somewhat in control
of the <b>de facto legislative entities</b>. This makes it possible for the executive
branch to suspend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law">rule of law</a>
when it is deemed necessary. This is not ordinary corruption, but rather an organized
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state">state within the state</a>.
It's seemingly used to ensure that the state operates efficiently, and
is more effective than would be possible
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a>. In this extreme model
the <b>de facto laws</b> passed within the authorities sometimes
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a>) decide the outcome
of court cases. In an attempt to prevent this the administrative courts sometimes
do the work that should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a>
be performed by the authorities. This work is performed within the
<b>de facto authorities</b> inside the administrative courts, in compliance with
the public laws.</p>

If this model, or a similar one, is an accurate description of the Swedish
[de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) system of government, then
some questions arise: Is this system really reconcilable with the classic definition of 
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law)?
If not, does Sweden deserve its
[reputation for strong rule of law](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Sweden/wb_ruleoflaw/)?
Could it be that this organized suspension of the
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law)
has strong benefits that can partly explain the 
[effectiveness of the Swedish
government](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Sweden/wb_government_effectiveness/)?
If so, is Sweden
[preaching one thing to the world](https://sweden.se/society/the-swedish-system-of-government/),
and practicing another? Many more questions arise of course.

If a model similar to those proposed here is an accurate description of the Swedish
[de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) system of
government, then my personal experiences interacting with this
system become much easier to explain. This of course is a mixed blessing
in this context: when a model explains your personal experiences it is easy
to place too high a [posterior probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability)
on the uncertain proposition that the model is correct in an
[objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability) sense.
Is this really science?
At the same time, experiments are in a philosophical sense personal experiences.
It's not entirely clear to me where the line should be drawn between the
[subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Subjective_probability&redirect=no)
and the [objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability).

This post is labeled within two categories: [probability theory](/category/probability)
and [social science](/category/social). The methodology here comes largly from
[subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Subjective_probability&redirect=no)
[probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory)
and is inspired by [Jaynes (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423).
If this post results in any novel contributions then they would probably
fall within fields like
[political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science),
[jurisprudence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence),
[economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics)
and perhaps even [sociology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology). There could also
be a contribution to the study of [methodology within
social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science#Methodology)
as a whole. If so, then it can perhaps be described as an application of
a [hypothetico-deductive method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model)
to the social sciences. I should be clear that nothing in this post proves
to me that any of the models presented here are correct. To me they are only plausible,
given the data I have today and the interpretations of that data I can currently see.
I could change my mind tomorrow.

![Cover of Jaynes 2003](/img/jaynes-robot.jpg)
<p class="caption">Figure 2. The methodology behind this post is inspired by
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423">Jaynes (2003)</a>,
his treatment of plausible reasoning and the concept of the Robot introduced
in the book. Note that Jaynes thought that it would be reasonable for the
Robot to reason about the proposition that Beethoven and Berlioz never met.
As I see it that requires a model of social reality, similar to the models
I try to reason about here. Note also that Jaynes thought that the Robot concept
should not be used to reason about the plausibility of a proposition decribing
the relative qualities of different musical works. I will do my best to avoid that
here. I therefore do not go very deep into the question of whether or not this
is a good way to run a country. I feel a different methodology is probably required
in order to answer such questions.
</p>

I try to outline here how a rational agent like the Robot could in principle reason
about social reality and [infer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference)
models of it. There could possibily be a contribution to the field of
[artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
here, but I don't know to what extent my thinking aligns with current research in
this field. If you'd care to enlighten me, please contact me
[on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bjornsing). I guess
[cognitive science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_science) and
[psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology) deal with similar questions.
I'd love to hear some views from those angles too.

## Historic Background

I start with a historic background, so that you can get a feel for the
[prior probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) that
I place on different possible models of the Swedish system of government. If
you feel this is an incorrect, biased or irrelevant summary of historical
developments, then you should question the probabilistic reasoning further
below. In that case you place entirely different
[prior probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability) over
the possible models and are unlikely to interpret data in the same way as I do.
This doesn't mean either of us is wrong. We just see the world differently.
I'd love to hear your thoughts [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bjornsing).

Sweden is still formally a monarchy, and democracy developed here in
a different way than in may other countries. If you go back to medieval
times the king's power was [largely unconstrained by the
laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Sweden_(800%E2%80%931521)).
The first meeting [said to bear any resemblance to today's parliament, the
Riksdag, was held in 1435](http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/sa-funkar-riksdagen/demokrati/riksdagens-historia/).
I think most historians would agree that the Riksdag's power from then on
slowly grew, at the expense of the king's. In 1809 the first
constitutional law that clearly separated power between the Riksdag and the
king ("regeringsformen") was passed. As part of that reform the courts and
the government authorities were granted some independance from the king, and
an [ombudsman](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ombudsman) called
[Justitieombudsmannen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Ombudsman)
was instated. People who felt wronged by the king, the authorities or the
courts could turn to this [ombudsman](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ombudsman)
with their complaints. The inspiration
for this system of government is said to have been the thinking of the french
political philosopher
[Montesquieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu) and his thoughts on
the [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers).

However, to the best of my knowledge there was really never any strong
popular uprising against the king's authority, similar to those in
[England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta),
[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) or the
[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States).
The king's power was seemingly questioned by the elites, and slowly
transferred to the Riksdag in law, but it seems to me a reasonable assumption
that the average citizen held the king in quite high regard and felt no urgent
need for this process to take place. It seems plausible to me that informal
power thus remained with the king to a rather high degree, and that this
informal power was then
transferred to the central executive branch of the government, the
Regering, in another slow process. The concept of
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) thus never gained
widespread popular support.

This second process was finalized in 1974 when the most central of our constitutional laws
("regeringsformen") was changed so that the king could no longer
["Rule the Kingdom alone"](https://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/monarchytheroyalcourt/themonarchyinsweden.4.396160511584257f2180005799.html).
The new wording states that
[all public power in Sweden derives from the people](https://lagen.nu/1974:152#P1S1).
This statement seems to be very important to many Swedes.

The same paragraph also states that
[all public power in Sweden is excercised under the laws](https://lagen.nu/1974:152#P1S1).
This is as I see it the clearest single statement in Swedish constitutional law mandating
that the executive branch respect the Riksdag's role as the national legislature and the
supreme decision-making body of Sweden. To me this is also the clearest single statement
mandating that the executive branch respect the
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) ("rättsstaten").
However, I'm a 40-year-old Swede, and
I can't remember being thought this in school, or hearing any public discussion on the
importance of this statement. This of course makes me somewhat unsure about the interpretation.
I haven't put any massive amount of time into researching the legislator's
intention. But it also makes me think that not many Swedes see the
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law) as very important.

The above makes me think that a relatively high
[prior probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_probability)
should be placed on models in which the executive branch of the
government is less constrained by law than it perhaps should be
[de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure).

## The Standard Model of Government in Sweden

From the written laws we can derive a standard model of government in Sweden
(see Figure 3). This is fully reconcilable with e.g.
[official information material on the Swedish system of government](https://sweden.se/society/the-swedish-system-of-government/).

![De jure model of the Swedish system of government](/img/sweden-de-jure.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 3. A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a>
model of the Swedish system of government. The people elects the Riksdag.
The Riksdag makes law, constitutional as well as ordinary. The laws are
written and public. The Riksdag tolerates the Regering. The Regering appoints the
director of the authorities under the Regering, like Authority A and
Authority B. Authorities are ensured some independence under constitutional
law, but are to a large degree controlled by the Regering. Authorities like
A and B must comply with the laws. There are
two types of courts, the general and the administrative, and these operate
relatively independently of the executive branch. The Justitieombudsmannen
(JO) receives complaints from the people, and performs investigations to
ensure that the courts and the authorities follow the law.
</p>

## New Data That Is Hard To Explain

The events surrounding the former director of the
[Swedish Transport Authority](https://transportstyrelsen.se/en/road/),
Maria Ågren, are very hard to explain under the standard model of the
Swedish system of government. The information below comes from
[a media report](https://www.lag-avtal.se/arbetsdomstolen/maria-agren-i-ad-jag-litade-pa-min-sakerhetschef-6941487)
on statements Ågren has made in a court hearing. She seems to have been
[herd under a relatively mild oath ("sanningsförsäkran")](https://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/transportstyrelsen-regeringen-ville-inte-ha-offentlig-rattegang-om-it-skandalen/?site=mobile).

In late 2015, when it was becoming apparent that an IT project within
the transport authority would be delayed unless Ågren ordered that a
so-called "deviation" ("avsteg") from the law should be made,
Ågren issued four formal orders. These seem to have contained instructions
on which laws should temporarily be suspended within the authority.

Ågren has previously acted as director of two other government
authorities. She claims that "deviations" such as the ones she seems to
have issued within the transport authority where common there, even in
cases concerning e.g. lawfull posession of firearms. When asked why she did
not inform the Regering about these "deviations" she answered that this
is not common practice, that the information was "sensitive" and that the
Regering would be flooded with such information if all "deviations"
were reported.

In this specific case the "deviations" had national security consequences,
and the
[Swedish Security Service](http://www.sakerhetspolisen.se/en/swedish-security-service.html)
therefore took an interest in them. Ågren was informed of this, but at that
stage the project was just days from completion, and she seemingly felt that
this "deviation" was justified.
It seems clear that she did not stop the project or recind
any of her four orders. When she was contacted by the security services again
in Febrary 2017, this time to notify her that she was formally suspected of
a crime, she was "very chocked" ("väldigt chockad").

Her union is apparently arguing that
[this culture of rampant "deviations" ("utpräglad avstegskultur") is a normal
part of the Swedish model of government](https://www.lag-avtal.se/arbetsdomstolen/facket-det-fanns-en-avstegskultur-fore-maria-agren-6928620).

It should of course be considered here that Ågren and her union have
an economic incentive to exagerate the extent of this culture of rampant
"deviations": they are pursuing a claim against the state for wrongful
termination.

## Models Under Which The Data Is More Likely

It's quite clear that the statements above, if truthful, are very hard to
explain under the standard model of the Swedish system of government. Arguing
along the lines of the Robot in
[Jaynes (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511790423)
we should therefore consider other models, under which the data is more likely.
Such a model is presented in Figure 4.
This can be seen as a form of [bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).
The model in Figure 4 was of course always a possible model of political life
in Sweden. The only thing that has happened is that we now place a higher
[posterior probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability) on that model.

![A first de facto model of the Swedish system of government](/img/sweden-de-facto-1.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 4. A first model of the Swedish
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> system
of government. The difference compared to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure">de jure</a> model is that we have
inserted a <b>de facto legislative entity</b> and <b>de facto laws</b> into Authority A.
The director of Authority A is seemingly somewhat in control of the
legislative entity within the authority. The <b>de facto laws</b> apply within the
<b>de facto legal domain</b>. In this model that domain is restricted to the
authority itself and its interactions with the people.
</p>

It's somewhat uncertain how <b>de facto laws</b> are stored within authorities.
According to media reports of claims made by Ågren's union the transport
authority had a well established culture for temporary legislation of this
kind, and even
[formal document templates for the <b>de facto laws</b>](https://www.lag-avtal.se/arbetsdomstolen/facket-det-fanns-en-avstegskultur-fore-maria-agren-6928620).

It is also somewhat unclear who is normally part of the <b>de facto legislative
entitiy</b>. In this case at least one of the <b>de facto laws</b> seems to have
been proposed by
[the head of security ("säkerhetsskyddschefen")](https://www.lag-avtal.se/arbetsdomstolen/maria-agren-i-ad-jag-litade-pa-min-sakerhetschef-6941487),
and passed by Ågren.

But it's still, under this model, hard to explain why Ågren was so surprised
when she heard that she was suspected of a crime. She seemingly knew that the
security services had their eyes on the situation. She seemingly knew that
the authority's <b>de facto legislative entity</b> had temporarily suspended some
public laws. Assuming she was reasonably rational in Jaynes' sense of the
word, it seems her model of the Swedish [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto)
system of government must have been different. One possible model that could
explain her surprise is presented in Figure 5.

![A second de facto model of the Swedish system of government](/img/sweden-de-facto-2.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 5. A second model of the Swedish
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> system
of government. The difference compared to the first model is that
we have inserted a <b>de facto legislative entity</b> and <b>de facto laws</b> into
Authority B as well, and also connected the two <b>de facto legislative entities</b> to
indicate that there could be communication between them, either directly
or through the Regering. The <b>de facto legal domain</b> is now extended to
include both Authority A and Authority B. The two authorities form one
legal domain within which the <b>de facto laws</b> of both authorities are
respected.
</p>

This second model could
explain Ågren's surprise: When she was informed that the security services
(Authority B) were concerned about the <b>de facto laws</b> within her authority
(Authority A) she seems to have taken the step to
[keep one of the Regering's employees, Erik Bromander, informed of the situation](https://www.lag-avtal.se/arbetsdomstolen/facket-det-fanns-en-avstegskultur-fore-maria-agren-6928620).
Perhaps she assumed that he would relay this information to the security
services and that the link between the two authorities' <b>de facto
legislative entities</b> was now established. Perhaps she assumed that the
two authorities were now operating within one <b>de facto legal domain</b>,
and that the <b>de facto laws</b> she had passed would be respected by the
security services. When the security services notified her that she was
formally suspected of a crime she was surprised, because that meant
that this model of reality was not correct in this specific case.
This seems like a somewhat plausible explanation to me.

If that is the explanation we can infer some other things about this
model of the Swedish [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto)
system of government: not all authorities have the same culture around
<b>de facto laws</b>. The security services do not seem to always respect
those of other authorities, at least not when they put national security
at risk to save a few bucks. Also, for this to have happened it seems to me
that either the information about the transport authority's
<b>de facto laws</b> was not relayed to the security services, or the message
that the <b>de facto laws</b> would not be respected was not relayed back.
Otherwise Ågren would probably have recinded her orders and
stopped the IT project. She claims she was never informed that there could
be criminal liability (other than through the public written laws of course).
Could it be that the security services believe in the
[rule of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law)?

Finally there is one more data point here that is hard to expain even under the
model in Figure 5: Ågren and her union is pursuing a claim against the state for
wrongful termination. That, to me, means that Ågren and her union most likely
believes that the courts will respect the transport authority's <b>de facto laws</b>
to some extent, and could find in her favour. That is as I see it unlikely
even under the model presented in Figure 5. A model that could explain Ågren's and
her union's social behavior is presented in Figure 6.

![A third model of the Swedish de facto system of government](/img/sweden-de-facto-3.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 6. A third model of the Swedish
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> system
of government. The difference compared to the second
model is that we have extended the <b>de facto legal domain</b> to
include the courts, in order to show that it is under this model reasonable
to expect a Swedish court to ascribe some importance to <b>de facto laws</b>
passed by the <b>de facto legislative entitiy</b> within an authority.
Possibly this requires that the Regering is informed and approves of the
<b>de facto laws</b>.
</p>

So why should I believe the model presented in Figure 6 to be a plausible one,
just because Ågren and her union seems to think it is? Well, Ågren obviously has
much more data than I do. She has been a director of government
authorities, for years. I know that she knows much more about this than I do. Therefore
I ascribe some importance to the models that she could possibly be reasoning from.

But we are obviously reasoning on rather thin ice here. And unfortunately it's
difficult to do experiments within the national security domain.
Just look at what unexpectedly happened to Ågren.

## Past Personal Experiences Interpreted In A New Way

Now having placed higher
[posterior probabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability)
on some alternative models I feel a need to review some past personal experiences that
I found hard to explain at the time.

### What Happended And What I Thought At The Time

In 2016 I requested redacted copies of some documents from the local police authority.
I had reviewed the [public laws](http://lagen.nu) and believed I had the right to do so.

When I did not receive redacted copies, but instead a strangely worded decision document
I was surprised. An e-mail exchange with the authority's legal department followed. The
exchange was very puzzling to me: the legal reasoning seemed to me not at all reconcilable
with the [public laws](http://lagen.nu). I thought the authority had something to hide,
so when I was instructed to appeal their decision to an administrative court I did.

The administrative court found in my favour and ordered the police authority to review
the documents, redact the classified information and give me the redacted copies. I thought
I would now receive redacted copies.

Instead I received a very long decision document from the authority with more legal
reasoning that seemed to me irreconcilable with the [public laws](http://lagen.nu).
I thought to myself: What could possibly explain this? Could it be incompetence?
Isn't it more likely they do have something to hide? I wanted to know, so I appealed
this decision as well.

The administrative court again found in my favour. But this time it did not order the
police authority to do the work. Instead the court had itself reviewed the documents,
redacted the classified information and created the redacted copies. I received the
redacted copies along with the court's written opinion. I was surprised by this. I thought
the court would just issue a clearer or harsher order.

When I looked at the redacted copies I felt disappointed. There was nothing in there that
was very interesting. Sure, some information had been redacted, but from the context I could see
that it was very unlikely that the originals contained anything I would consider sensitive or
interesting.

I was puzzled. Obviously I had been wrong: the authority probably did not have anything
to hide. This was not the explanation for their behavior. What could possibly explain it?
I felt cheated in some way. I felt there was nothing more I could do to understand why
this had happened. I still learned something from the experience though: just because the
legal department of some authority is probably wrong doesn't mean you can
[infer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) some simple motive.
I thought perhaps they have a very strange working culture.

### What I Think Now

In light of the new data regarding Ågren, and the models I have
[inferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) from that data, I think it is
possible to understand this experience differently.

Firstly, the lengthy exchange and two court cases may have been the result of
a misunderstanding: I thought the [public laws](http://lagen.nu) should govern our interaction. But
perhaps the legal department thought that <b>de facto laws</b> should govern our
interaction. This seems unlikely to me of course, but on the other hand the experience itself
is unlikely under the standard model of the Swedish system of government. Maybe legal departments
are often part of the authority's <b>de facto legislative entity</b>?

Secondly, I now find it easier to understand why the court did the work itself. The court probably
realized that it would be impossible to order the authority to perform the work. Perhaps
the court felt that the authority would always perform the work under their <b>de facto laws</b>,
and that the result would not be in reasonable compliance with the
[public laws](http://lagen.nu). Perhaps this is a common occurrence.

In light of the above reasoning I now place a higher
[posterior probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability)
on the model in Figure 7. Note that I'm now reinterpreting old data and using it
to adjust my posteriors. I'm unsure of how reasonable this is.

![A fourth model of the Swedish de facto system of government](/img/sweden-de-facto-4.png)
<p class="caption">Figure 7. A fourth model of the Swedish
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> system
of government. The difference compared to the third
model is that we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference">inferred</a>
from a reinterpretation of past experiences that administrative courts probably have
a <b>de facto authority</b> within them. This entity performs work that authorities
should do <a href="">de jure</a>, but which the court cannot trust them to do (because
they are known to operate under <b>de facto laws</b> and the work would therefore not
be done in reasonable compliance with public laws). In this model it should also be considered
likely that the legal department of the authority is part of the <b>de facto legislative
entity</b>. Their job is primarily to get the people and the courts to comply (in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto">de facto</a> sense) with the
authority's <b>de facto laws</b>. When this succeeds the <b>de facto legal domain</b> is
extended to include the courts.
</p>

Personally I feel that Figure 7 could quite possibly be an accurate and useful model
of the Swedish [de facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) system of government,
but that [inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) is based on much
more data than can be presented here. I don't think you should take my word for it, unless
you feel like I felt above regarding Ågren's possible beliefs.

## Future Work

I think any rational agent that feels a lot of uncertainty about what models of reality 
are correct, and also that reducing that uncertainty would have its benefits, should be
looking for more data. I've therefore sent an e-mail to the
[Swedish Labour Court](http://www.arbetsdomstolen.se/pages/page.asp?lngID=7&lngLangID=1)
asking for a list of documents and any recordings from Ågren's ongoing case.

I've also sent an e-mail to the [administrative court of appeals in Stockholm
("Kammarrätten")](http://www.kammarrattenistockholm.domstol.se/Funktioner/English/), asking
for copies of the documents from my own two court cases. I haven't kept good records of
these, and it feels reasonable to me to review them again in light of the alternative
models [inferred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) here. They sure cost
a lot of taxpayer money, needlessly.

I also sent off a couple of requests for documents concerning <b>de facto laws</b> and
the functioning of the <b>de facto legislative entities</b> at some authorities. Maybe something
interesting can come of this.

I'm also hoping for a [tweet or two](https://twitter.com/bjornsing), to feel more comfortable
with this analysis.  Cognition is a social thing you know. Please get in touch if you have any
thoughts on this. If you don't have Twitter you can email me at

I plan to follow up this post with one describing a single proposed model, and the data that
supports it. But I have a lot of plans. Can't make any promises.
